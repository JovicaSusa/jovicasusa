        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("Dream Holidays Insurance")) do %>
          My first project. A small little app perfect for a junior developer with no industry experience.
        <% end %>
        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("Thompson Learn")) do %>
          My first big project. It was quite challenging to start working on a Rails and Ember application
          with just few months of Rails experience and no Ember experience at all.
          But it was a fun ride and I learned so much in almost two years working on it.
        <% end %>
        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("Smily")) do %>
          I've worked for around 4 years on Smily product which consists of a lot of smaller applications written in Rails and Ember.js.
          I worked on the most of them but spent most of my time as integration developer, making sure that Smily integration works smoothly with
          Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com (and others).
        <% end %>
        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("Upstrive Education")) do %>
          Happy that I had the oportunity to contribute to this beneficial application. I worked on it while I was exploring my next career steps and
          it helped me to gain some React and React Native knowledge.
        <% end %>
        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("BSDX Exchange")) do %>
          On a six months gig I had an opportunity to help BSDX in shaping up their online crypto currency exchange.
        <% end %>
        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("Senukai.lt")) do %>
          Seeing what's out there behind the biggest Baltic online market was a great experience. I spent some time developing
          their loyalty program and imporving their mobile api.
        <% end %>
        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("HRX Latvia")) do %>
          Jumping on the project in the middle of the summer, having a deadline until the end of the summer doesn't sound too tempting,
          but delivering it on time helped with the overall experience.
        <% end %>
        <%= render(Shared::WorkCard.new("Mana pilsÄ“ta")) do %>
          It was a refresher to work on a Rails only app, just how we used to work years ago.

            Jovica has great grasp of Ruby (and Rails). He's got a keen instinct for simple solutions that get the job done. He provides valuable feedback during code reviews, always with empathy. His calmness helped centered our team in tough times, when something broke or we had to fix an urgent bug.
            He demonstrated impressive ownership of the product, where he proactively checked various dashboards and monitors for early signs of issues. Jumping on a pair programming call with him was always easy and productive.

            Working with Jovica was a great pleasure and I learned a lot from him. Any team will be lucky to have him as a member.

          <p>
            I had the pleasure of working with Jovica at Smily (formerly Bookingsync), and I was thoroughly impressed by his expertise in software architecture and development. Jovica possesses a deep understanding of both the technical and strategic aspects of software design, consistently delivering solutions that are not only robust but also scalable and maintainable.

            His ability to navigate complex challenges, break them down into manageable components, and implement them with precision is truly commendable. Jovica is a proactive problem-solver, always staying ahead of potential issues and ensuring that the project remains on track. His knowledge of Ruby on Rails was instrumental in the success of our project.

            Beyond his technical skills, Jovica is an excellent collaborator. He communicates complex ideas clearly and works seamlessly with cross-functional teams.

            Jovica played a key role in developing the reviews module for VRBO. Although we were on different subteams, I was always impressed by his technical expertise and the quality of his work. He did great work helping me develop the front-end parts of the project I was working on, advocating for Hotwire, which brought real-time functionality to the product.

            I highly recommend Jovica for any role that requires a blend of technical acumen and strategic vision. He would be a valuable asset to any team.
